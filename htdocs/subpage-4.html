                <h4>Early Career</h4>
                <p>
                    Alyssa Valdez started playing volleyball during her last years in elementary. She was recruited by coaches from University of 
                    Sto. Tomas whilst scouting in Valdez's hometown in San Juan Batangas. Coach Roger Gorayeb was the one to see potential in her.
                    In order to pursue the sport in the said school, she had to move away and live in the school dorm. 
                    There, she was joined by Kim Fajardo, a fellow Batangueno, and the towering Santiago sisters, Dindin and Jaja.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the environment and the sport were new to her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Valdez grew up in a humble home next to the breezy farmlands of San Juan, a great contrast to the hustling city of Manila. 
                    The intensity of volleybal varsity team training was also quite foreign to her. Although, as years went by, 
                    Alyssa improved her volleyball skills through rigourous trainings and her undying determination. 
                    She was even included in the Under-16 Philippine Team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She became a team captain in her last years of high school and led the Tigresses to championship wins; and was
                    even hailed as the Most Valuable Player. Her name became known within the volleyball community. It was a thrill for 
                    everyone to see a budding legend in the making. That was why when she was in her last year of high school, a lot
                    of the universities included in the NCAA and the UAAP tried to recruit her.
                </p>

                <h4>College Days</h4>
                <p>
                    Many expected Valdez to stay in her high school Alma Mater. Both her and her parents were also wary of transfering to 
                    another university when the time came. After all, it was under UST's wing that she cultivated her skills, and staying
                    until college would be a sign of gratefulness. But Coach Roger Gorayeb and the rest of the UST coaching staff told 
                    her that she need not to worry about that side of things. They affirmed her that no matter what her decision would be, they 
                    are nothing but supportive of her. In the end, Valdez chose to go to the Ateneo De Manila University where she would rise
                    to be the face of Philippine Volleyball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't very hard for her to adjust to her new teammates because she knew most of them already from high school, as oponents, or
                    as a teammate in the U-16 Team. To everyone's shock and delight, she was joined by Coach Gorayeb in her transfer to the school.
                    In an interview years after Valdez graduates from college, Gorayeb shared his aspirations for the then teenager. 
                    He said that he planned to cultivate Valdez as a player and make her the star of the team.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her stay in the Blue Eagle's nest in Katipunan, she led the team to its first championship in the 76th season of the 
                    UAAP Women's Volleyball. It was a bone-chilling historic event for all of the team members because no one was expecting them
                    to reach that far. In the latest PBB Kumunity Season, Valdez shared to the housemates the road to the unforseen triumph. 
                    She said that they only wished to be included in the Final Four. They almost gave up during trainings. But when the playoffs in the Final Four came, it was like their bodies could not just pass the 
                    chance up. And so they went up and up the step-ladder. At the top of it was their rival, the DLSU Green Archers who they had to 
                    beat 3 times to grab the long due championship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the historic Cinderella run, as many call it, they went on a perfect sweep the next season. Valdez graduated Ateneo with 2 championship
                    titles and many more individual awards. Some of her awards were: Best Server, Best Spiker, Best Scorer, Season MVP, and Finals MVP.

                <h4>Commercial and Professional Career After Graduating</h4>
                <p>
                    Sometime after graduating, she went to be an import in Thailand club teams. Nowadays, she is a part of the Creamline Cool Smashers
                    who she plays profesionally for.
