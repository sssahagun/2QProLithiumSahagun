                <h3>Volleyball Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    The history of volleyball in the Philippines dates back to 1910. 
                    The Physical Director of the YMCA, Elwood S. Brown, first introduced volleyball to the Philippines that year. 
                    Philippine people began to play volleyball as a backyard sport and games of beach volleyball soon followed, according to information from the Philippine Volleyball Federation, or PVF. 
                    Players hung the net between two trees. They made up their own rules regarding how many players on each side and how many times you could hit the ball before sending it over the net.

                <h3>Filipino Contributions</h3>
                <h4>The Three-Hit Limit</h4>
                <p>
                    The Philippine style of volleyball inspired the Americans to create the three-hit limit, according to information on the PVF website. 
                    Before the rule, Philippine volleyball teams would sometimes let every player hit the ball before sending it over to the opposing side. 
                    This took too much time and snuffed out the challenge and competitive nature of the game.
                </p>
                <h4>Set and Spike</h4>
                <p>
                    With the new three-hit rule in place, Philippine players experimented with new volleyball techniques and came up with the set and spike, a.k.a. the “Filipino Bomb.” 
                    In this offensive passing style, one player hits the volleyball and sends it high in the air to set it up for another player on her team. 
                    A second player then strikes the ball sending it over the net at a downward angle. This is called spiking the ball.

                <h3>The Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Every point starts off with one team serving the ball towards their opponent's court. A player from the other team 
                    recieves the ball and more often than not directs it to their setter who sets the ball to a player who is not the team's libero for a spike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A point is given when the ball touches the floor or the net's antennae.
                </p>
                <h4>Player Positions</h4>
                <p>
                    There can be at most 6 players on playing the court every rotation. Each position plays a certain crucial role in games. 
                    They each have their main specialties and responsibilities in their team. Below are the positions that one can take as player:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Outside Spiker</li>
                    <li>Opposite Spiker</li>
                    <li>Middle Blocker</li>
                    <li>Setter</li>
                    <li>Libero</li>
                </ol>
